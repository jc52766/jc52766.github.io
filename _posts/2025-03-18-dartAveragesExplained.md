A darts players average is a good indication of ability.<br/>
A complete beginners 3-dart average will likely be below 40.<br/>
A good players 3-dart average will be around 60.<br/>
An excellent players 3-dart average around 80.<br/>
And a professionals 3-dart averages 90+.<br/>
<br/>
A darts players 1-dart average for a leg is calculated as pnts/nd where pnts = how many points we scored during leg, nd = how many darts were throw in that leg.<br/>
A darts players average across multiple legs is calculated as pnts\*l/nd\*l where l is how many legs were played.<br/>
Then to convert to 3-dart average just do: 3\*1-dart average<br/>
<br/>
So when we win a leg it is representative of how many darts it took us to win: 501/nd<br/>
But when we lose a leg our average is no longer reflective of how many darts (on average) it took us to get to zero<br/>
This is an important distinction. Lets use 9-darters as an example<br/>
Highest possible 3-dart average on-throw = 3\*501/9=167<br/>
If my opponent throws a 9 darter and throws first then my highest possible 3-dart average (when 2nd to throw) is 3\*360/6=180<br/>
It is interesting to think that if ever 2 perfect darts players face off, both always throwing 9-darters then the 1st to throw wins the match and the 2nd to throw will have the highest average.<br/>
This is one thing that confuses people a little. There are times when a losing player will have a much higher average than the winning player. I've seen instances where the losing professional player will have an average ~10 points higher than the winning player. So why is this? I mean how can one player have such a higher average but still lose?<br/>
<br/>
One reason is that averages can be heavily influenced by outliers.
Have a shocking leg and your average dips significantly.
Have one or a couple amazing legs (a 9,10 or 11 darter) and that average may lift significantly. The worst situation is when these amazing legs happen on-throw when the on-throw player likely would've won the leg anyway with a much less amazing, more mediocre, performance. And this is the crux of it. If 15 darts would've done then what good really is 9,10 or 11 darts for example. It increases your average but not your probability of winnining the match. And this is the crux behind how averages and winning percentages can diverge.<br/>
<br/>
But the most common reason comes down to on-throw v off-throw average. When on-throw you get to throw first which means you get 3 more scoring darts than your opponent. And that means a nice buffer where on-throw you don't need to throw as well to win the leg. If your best throwing is when on-throw and your worst is off-throw then you have could a problem. Much better is if your average quality throws occur on-throw (when you already have 3 extra darts in hand anyway) and your above-average quality throws occur when off-throw. The averages may be the same across the 2 scenarios but your chances of winning are much higher in the 2nd scenario.<br/>
<br/>
It all comes down to timing and not averages at the end of the day.
